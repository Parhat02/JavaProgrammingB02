Array vs Collection: both supports non primitives

		Array: Size is fixed
			   Supports both primitives & non-primitives
			   Can be mult-dimensional

			   Faster than Collection


		Collection: Size is dynamic
					Supports non-primitives ONLY
					Can not be multidimensional

					Ready methods


Map (I): Collection of Pairs (key & value)
		 Supports non-primitives ONLY
		 Size is dynamic
		 Key MUST be unique, value can be duplicated


		1. HashMap (C): Random order
						Both key and value can be null


		2. LinkedHashMap (C): Insertion order
							  Both key and value can be null


		3. TreeMap (C): Sorted order
						Key can not be null, values can be null


		4. HashTable (C): Random order
						  Both key and value can NOT be null
						  Synchronized

Methods of Map:
		put(key, value): inserts the given key and value to the Map as a pair (entry)
							can also be used for updating the values of exsiting keys

		size(): returns the total number of pairs

		get(key): returns the value of the specified key

		replace(key, newValue): replaces the value of the specified key with the new value

		remove(key): removes the pair with the matching key from the map

		containsKey(key): returns true if the specified key is included in the map, otherwise returns false

		containsValue(Value): returns true if the specified Value is included in the map, otherwise returns false
